If you are working on a physical SenseHAT, it can be tricky to design the image you want to use for the LED matrix.

The simplest way is to get a piece of graph paper you can use to create an 8 by 8 grid. 
Draw lines around a square with sides of 8 unit lengths, and colour in each 'pixel' the way you would like to make your image:

To help you design an image that will fit on the LED array, we have also created a simple online tool in Scratch. You can show different colours by clicking on each square in the array that appears.

**Try:** Use the Pick-a-Pixel tool to design an image you would like to display.

**Tip:** Don't make it too complex, or it will be hard to make out on the LED array (and difficult to animate).

When you have finished designing your image, transcribe each of the pixel colours to a term in your image list, making sure you have 8 terms separated by commas on each line.
